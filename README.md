### Nice to see you here! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=ramyac6.ramyac6&style=flat-square&color=0088cc)

I'm a second year undergraduate student in Computer Science at the University of Washington, Seattle. I'm a avid learner with a long list of technologies and languages that I want to learn. I enjoy exploring new tech stacks across a variety of platforms that can then be appleid to solve real-life problems. I'm currently interested in backend work and working on app development with React Native.
